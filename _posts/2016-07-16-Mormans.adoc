= Mormans

I had a interesting chat on the driveway today with a couple of Morman missionaries who were riding past on their bikes. I suspect it was God's strange way of answering my prayer on Thursday night that the men of our church have opportunities to share the good news of Jesus.

We talked about Jesus as the One Shephard, grace vs works, how the Book of Morman fits in to our beliefs (or not!)

I pray they go on their way focussed on God's grace through Jesus.
