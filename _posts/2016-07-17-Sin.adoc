= Sin

Some word pictures of sin: 

- Shooting at a target and missing it 
- Poison (pure or diluted with lots of water, it will still kill you)

We compare ourselves to people we consider "sinners", but the only standard God has is Himself.

My son has a dairy allergy. If he ingests a dairy product, he will react in a bad way. In the same way, God is allergic to anything imperfect (ie sin). He can't choose to overlook it or just put up with it.

Since God's standard is perfection, and he must deal with sin by destroying it, what hope do we have?

Romans 3:25 God gave Jesus as a way to forgive sin through faith. And all of this is because of the blood of Jesus' death...
