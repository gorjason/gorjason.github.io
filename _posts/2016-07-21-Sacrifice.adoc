= Sacrifice

Psalm 50

God isn't interested in us working out a religious system where we do things to compensate for sinning. He wants a relationship with us based on trust in Him and love for Him. This will show itself in gratitude and joyful actions - a "sacrifice of thanksgiving" for the goodness of God. Then we even get to feast and share the sacrifice meal with God.
